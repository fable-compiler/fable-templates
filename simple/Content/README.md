# Fable Simple Template

This template can be used to generate a simple web app with [Fable](http://fable.io/).
You can find more templates by searching `Fable.Template` packages in [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org).

## Requirements

* [dotnet SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) 2.0 or higher
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org) 6.11 or higher
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com): JS package manager
* [mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) on macOS/Linux to run [paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/).

## Editor

The project can be used by editors compatible with the new .fsproj format, like VS Code + [Ionide](http://ionide.io/), Emacs with [fsharp-mode](https://github.com/fsharp/emacs-fsharp-mode) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/). **Visual Studio for Mac** is also compatible but in the current version the package auto-restore function conflicts with Paket so you need to disable it: `Preferences > Nuget > General`.

## Installing the template

In a terminal, run `dotnet new -i Fable.Template` to install or update the template to the latest version.

## Creating a new project with the template

In a terminal, run `dotnet new fable` to create a project in the current directory. Type `dotnet new fable -n MyApp` instead to create a subfolder named `MyApp` and put the new project there.

> The project will have the name of the directory. You may get some issues if the directory name contains some special characters like hyphens

## Building and running the app

> In the commands below, yarn is the tool of choice. If you want to use npm, just replace `yarn` by `npm` in the commands.

* Install dependencies: `yarn`
* Start Fable daemon and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) dev server: `yarn start`
* In your browser, open: http://localhost:8080/

> Check the `scripts` section in `package.json` for more info. If you are using VS Code + [Ionide](http://ionide.io/), you can also use F5 or Ctrl+Shift+B (Cmd+Shift+B on macOS) instead of typing `yarn start`. With this Fable-specific errors will be highlighted in the editor along with other F# errors. See _Debugging in VS Code_ below.

Any modification you do to the F# code will be reflected in the web page after saving. When you want to output the JS code to disk, run `yarn build` and you'll get your frontend files ready for deployment in the `build` folder.

## Debugging in VS Code

* Install [Debugger For Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) in vscode
* Press F5 in vscode
* After all the .fs files are compiled, the browser will be launched
* Set a breakpoint in F#
* Restart with Ctrl+Shift+F5 (Cmd+Shift+F5 on macOS)
* The breakpoint will be caught in vscode

## Project structure

### Paket

[Paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/) is the package manager used for F# dependencies. It doesn't need a global installation, the binary is included in the `.paket` folder. Other Paket related files are:

- **paket.dependencies**: contains all the dependencies in the repository.
- **paket.references**: there should be one such a file next to each `.fsproj` file.
- **paket.lock**: automatically generated, but should be committed to source control, [see why](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/faq.html#Why-should-I-commit-the-lock-file).
- **Nuget.Config**: prevents conflicts with Paket in machines with some Nuget configuration.

> Paket dependencies will be installed in a cache. See [Paket website](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/) for more info.

### yarn

- **package.json**: contains the JS dependencies together with other info, like development scripts.
- **yarn.lock**: is the lock file created by yarn.

> JS dependencies will be installed in `node_modules`. See [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) website for more info.

### Webpack

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) is a bundler, which links different JS sources into a single file making deployment much easier. It also offers other features, like a static dev server that can automatically refresh the browser upon changes in your code or a minifier for production release. Fable interacts with Webpack through the `fable-loader`.

Webpack configuration files are in the `tools` directory. If you need to edit them, check [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) website for more information.

### F# source files

The template only contains two F# source files: the project (.fsproj) and a source file (.fs) in `src` folder.
